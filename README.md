## Lessons learned from project
Through coding a CS website for my department, I've learned some invaluable lessons that extend far beyond technical skills:
I discovered the importance of planning, setting achievable goals, and managing tasks effectively. Breaking down a large project into smaller, manageable parts and sticking to timelines was key.
Coding isn't just about writing lines; it's about tackling challenges. Debugging errors, addressing technical issues, and incorporating user feedback taught me persistence and creative problem-solving.
 realized the significance of designing for the end-user. Creating intuitive interfaces that cater to the specific needs of my school community was eye-opening.
 I learned to be adaptable in my approach, adjusting to changing requirements and unforeseen circumstances.
Balancing schoolwork, personal life, and the website project required effective time management. Meeting deadlines while juggling multiple tasks taught me to allocate time wisely.
Finally, completing the CS website project for my school instilled a sense of pride and accomplishment. It serves as a tangible representation of my skills and dedication, possibly becoming a valuable piece in my portfolio for future opportunities.
